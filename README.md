# ðŸ”¥ PyTorch Model Project

This repository contains a machine learning project built using **PyTorch**.  
It demonstrates how to design, train, evaluate, and test a deep learning model from scratch.  
The goal of this project is to provide a clear example of using PyTorch for real-world tasks such as classification, regression, or natural language processing.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Data preprocessing and loading with `torch.utils.data.Dataset` and `DataLoader`.
- Custom PyTorch model built with `torch.nn.Module`.
- Training loop with forward pass, loss computation, and backpropagation.
- Model evaluation on test data.
- Saving and loading trained models for future use.
- Example usage with Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts.

ðŸ“– Explanation

This project is designed to help learners and researchers:

Understand how PyTorch models are structured.

Learn the workflow of deep learning projects (data â†’ model â†’ training â†’ testing).

Explore different architectures (MLP, CNN, RNN, etc.) by modifying model.py.

Use the project as a template for future ML/DL experiments.
cd your-repo-name
